# city-decider

City Decider app to help Jamie decide where she should move next. 

Built with Vue/VueX.

I used the Accuweather API to get weather data. It was taking me too long to find the data for the flights, so it is hardcoded for now.

** It is using the free version of the Accuweather API, this has a maximum number of requests allowed to it. If it this limit has been reached, then the data call will fail.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```

```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```

```
