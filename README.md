# city-decider

City Decider app to help Jamie decide where she should move next. 

Built with Vue/VueX.

I used the Accuweather API to get weather data. It was taking me too long to find the data for the flights, so it is hardcoded for now.

If I was to spend longer on this, I would:  
    * Connect to a flights API and use that to show flights data  
    * Change the image backgrounds setup so that all images are loaded initially, so there isn't that awkward loading of the image when a city is first clicked  
    * Add Vue animations, choose better colors and add an icon library.

Thanks for taking the time to look at my app, I had fun making it :)
